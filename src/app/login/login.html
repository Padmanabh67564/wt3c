/*🧩 What this file is:

This is the login page (HTML template) of my Angular project.
It shows the login form on the screen and connects it with the TypeScript code that will check the login details.

🧱 Line-by-line in simple words
<div class="container mt-5 col-md-4">

This makes a small box in the center of the page using Bootstrap (for nice design).

<h3>Login</h3>

Shows the heading “Login”.

<form (ngSubmit)="loginUser()">

This means when the user clicks the Login button, the function loginUser() (from the TypeScript file) will run.

<input type="email" [(ngModel)]="email" ... />

It’s a box where the user types their email.

[(ngModel)]="email" connects the input to a variable called email in the TypeScript file.
So whatever the user types is stored in that variable.

<input type="password" [(ngModel)]="password" ... />

It’s a box for the password.

Works the same way as the email input — it stores what the user types in the password variable.

<button class="btn btn-success w-100" type="submit">Login</button>

It’s a Login button.

When clicked, it submits the form and runs the loginUser() function.

💬 In simple words to say in viva:

“This is my Angular login form.
It takes the user’s email and password using [(ngModel)] for two-way data binding.
When the user clicks Login, it runs the loginUser() function from the TypeScript file.
I used Bootstrap classes to make it look neat and centered.*/
