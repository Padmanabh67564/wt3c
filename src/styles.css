/*Answer:
Angular is a framework by Google used to build single-page web applications (SPAs) using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

✅ Syntax Example:

ng new my-app    # to create a new Angular project
ng serve         # to run the project

⚙️ 2️⃣ What is a Component?

Answer:
A component is the basic building block of an Angular app — it controls a part of the screen (view).

✅ Basic Syntax:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-sample',
  templateUrl: './sample.html',
  styleUrls: ['./sample.css']
})
export class SampleComponent {
  title = 'Hello Angular';
}


✅ Say in viva:

“A component has an HTML file for design, a TypeScript file for logic, and a CSS file for styling.”

⚙️ 3️⃣ What is @Component?

Answer:
@Component is a decorator that tells Angular this class is a component and gives information like selector, HTML, and CSS file names.

✅ Syntax:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-login',
  templateUrl: './login.html',
  styleUrls: ['./login.css']
})

⚙️ 4️⃣ What is Data Binding?

Answer:
Data binding connects the HTML and TypeScript so data can flow between them.

✅ Types of Data Binding:

Type	Syntax	Description
Interpolation	{{ title }}	Displays data
Property binding	[value]="name"	Sets property value
Event binding	(click)="myFunction()"	Handles events
Two-way binding	[(ngModel)]="email"	Syncs data both ways

✅ Example:

<input [(ngModel)]="email" placeholder="Enter email">
<p>{{ email }}</p>

⚙️ 5️⃣ What is ngModel?

Answer:
ngModel allows two-way data binding between an input field and a variable.

✅ Syntax:

<input [(ngModel)]="username">


✅ Example (TS):

username = 'Padmanabh';

⚙️ 6️⃣ What is Routing in Angular?

Answer:
Routing lets us navigate between pages (components) without reloading the browser.

✅ Syntax (app.routes.ts):

import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { Login } from './login/login';
import { Register } from './register/register';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'register', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'register', component: Register },
  { path: 'login', component: Login }
];


✅ In HTML:

<a routerLink="/login">Login</a>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>


✅ Say:

“Routing connects URLs to components using routerLink and router-outlet.”

⚙️ 7️⃣ What is RouterLink?

Answer:
Used to navigate between pages.

✅ Syntax:

<a routerLink="/profile">Go to Profile</a>

⚙️ 8️⃣ What is RouterOutlet?

Answer:
A placeholder where the routed component is displayed.

✅ Syntax (in app.html):

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

⚙️ 9️⃣ What is a Service in Angular?

Answer:
A service is used to share data and logic between multiple components.

✅ Syntax:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class UserService {
  registerUser(user: any) {
    console.log('User Registered:', user);
  }
}


✅ Say:

“My UserService handles registration, login, and logout.”

⚙️ 🔟 What is Dependency Injection?

Answer:
It means Angular automatically provides (injects) required objects (like services) into components.

✅ Syntax:

constructor(private userService: UserService) {}


✅ Say:

“Angular injects my UserService into the component so I can use it directly.”

⚙️ 11️⃣ What is ngOnInit()?

Answer:
A lifecycle hook that runs automatically when the component loads.

✅ Syntax:

ngOnInit() {
  console.log('Component loaded');
}


✅ Say:

“In my Profile component, I used ngOnInit() to check if the user is logged in.”

⚙️ 12️⃣ What is LocalStorage?

Answer:
LocalStorage stores data in the browser permanently (until cleared manually).

✅ Syntax:

localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');


✅ Say:

“I used LocalStorage to store and retrieve registered user data.”

⚙️ 13️⃣ What is a Standalone Component?

Answer:
A standalone component does not need to be declared in any module — it works independently.

✅ Syntax:

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-login',
  imports: [FormsModule],
  templateUrl: './login.html'
})


✅ Say:

“All my components are standalone, so no module file is required.”

⚙️ 14️⃣ What is a Directive?

Answer:
A directive changes how an HTML element behaves or appears.

✅ Examples:

<p *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome!</p>
<li *ngFor="let user of users">{{ user.name }}</li>


✅ Say:

“I used *ngIf and *ngFor directives in my project.”

⚙️ 15️⃣ What is Interpolation?

Answer:
Interpolation displays variable data from TypeScript into HTML.

✅ Syntax:

<h2>Welcome {{ username }}</h2>


✅ Example (TS):

username = 'Padmanabh';

⚙️ 16️⃣ What are Pipes in Angular?

Answer:
Pipes are used to format data in HTML.

✅ Syntax:

{{ today | date }}
{{ name | uppercase }}


✅ Say:

“Pipes help format data like converting text to uppercase or formatting dates.”

⚙️ 17️⃣ What is app.ts?

Answer:
The main (root) Angular component that connects everything.

✅ Syntax:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.html'
})
export class App {
  title = 'My Angular App';
}


✅ Say:

“This is my main Angular component where RouterOutlet loads other pages.”

⚙️ 18️⃣ What is app.routes.ts?

Answer:
Contains all the route definitions that connect paths (URLs) to components.

✅ Syntax:

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'login', component: Login },
  { path: 'register', component: Register }
];


✅ Say:

“This file defines how users move between pages.”

⚙️ 19️⃣ What are the main files in an Angular project?
File	Purpose
main.ts	Starts the Angular app
app.ts	Root component logic
app.html	Root component UI
app.routes.ts	Defines routing paths
user.ts	Custom service for user data
index.html	Main HTML file that loads the app
⚙️ 20️⃣ What are advantages of Angular?

✅ Answer:

Single Page Application

Fast and structured

Two-way data binding

Component-based

Built-in routing

Reusable code

✅ Say:

“Angular makes web apps faster, cleaner, and easier to maintain.”

💬 Sample Viva Summary You Can Say:

“Angular is a frontend framework by Google that uses TypeScript.
I created standalone components like Register, Login, and Profile.
I used routing to move between pages and [(ngModel)] for two-way data binding.
My UserService handles user registration, login, and logout using LocalStorage.
I used RouterOutlet to load pages and routerLink for navigation.*/
